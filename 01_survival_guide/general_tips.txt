In Fortran matrices are saved column wise.
Interesting sizes of the matrices we should consider: N in [100, 1000].
Produce plots with 
    x axis = size of the matrices;
    y axis = CPU time.
    Compute it with different random matrices

Different ways of compute the matrix multiplication:
    matmul library
    Row by column
    Row by column swithching order of loops (Column by row)
    Exploit the compiler optimization flags
    Transpose the first matrix
